This is my favorite Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe: 

Ingredients
200 g (1.66 cups) wheat flour (type 405) or spelt flour (type 603)
90 g (0.5 cup) sugar
125 g (1 stick) vegan butter
8 g (1.5 tsp) vanilla sugar
5 g (1 tsp) baking powder
2 tbsp applesauce
150 g (0.33 lb) chocolate drops (bake-stable)
1 pinch of salt

Instructions
Combine flour, sugar, vegan butter, salt, vanilla sugar, baking powder and applesauce in a large bowl. Then, fold in the chocolate drops.

Preheat oven to 180 °C / 350 °F (convection heat). Divide the dough into 18 pieces of 40 g (1.5 oz) and form small balls. Next, place nine balls each on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, with some space in between.

Bake the cookies for 12 minutes. When you remove them from the oven, they should still be very soft. If desired, flatten slightly using a spatula. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 10 minutes before removing them from the baking tray.
